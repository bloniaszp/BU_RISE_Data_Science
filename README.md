## Course Overview  
In this course, students will:  
- Learn the principles of **formal statistical thinking** to gain insights into measurement, data collection, experimental design, and uncertainty quantification.  
- Analyze real-world datasets from fields like neuroscience, environmental science, physics, economics, and urban planning.  
- Develop skills in **computational modeling**, **scientific reproducibility**, and **rigorous ethical practices** for data-informed research.

## RISE Practicum  
The **RISE Practicum** provides students with hands-on project/research experience in in one of four key areas:  
1. **Time Series Analysis and/or Prediction**
2. **Biostatistics-Style Analysis** 
3. **Scientific Software Package Development** 
4. **Teaching a Statistical Technique**


The Practicum combines instructor-led morning lectures with collaborative lab work in the afternoon. Students will present their research findings at the **RISE Poster Symposium** at the program's conclusion.
