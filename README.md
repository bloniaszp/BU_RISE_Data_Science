# Boston University's RISE Data Science Practicum Track

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Data Science** RISE Practicum Track course! This course introduces formal statistical thinking and computational methodologies to empower high school students to become skilled computational scientists. Here, you'll find many of the resources, code, and collaborative materials necessary to succeed in the course and Practicum.

## Course Overview  
In this course, students will:  
- Learn the principles of **formal statistical thinking** to gain insights into measurement, data collection, experimental design, and uncertainty quantification.  
- Analyze real-world datasets from fields like neuroscience, environmental science, physics, economics, and urban planning.  
- Develop skills in **computational modeling**, **scientific reproducibility**, and **rigorous ethical practices** for data-informed research.

## RISE Practicum  
The **RISE Practicum** provides students with hands-on experience in conducting computational research in one of three key areas:  
1. **Computational modeling** (e.g., time series forecasting).  
2. **Statistical Method Benchmarking**.  
3. **Scientific Software Development**.  

The Practicum combines instructor-led morning lectures with collaborative lab work in the afternoon. Students will present their research findings at the **RISE Poster Symposium** at the program's conclusion.
